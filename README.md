# Purchase Amount Prediction Spark ML Project

**Introduction:**

Accurate prediction of purchase amounts is essential for businesses to optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and personalized marketing efforts. With the advent of big data, leveraging large datasets to forecast purchase behavior can significantly enhance decision-making processes. This project aims to utilize Spark ML, a powerful machine learning library for big data processing, to develop a model that predicts purchase amounts based on customer and transaction data.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to build  machine learning model using Spark ML to predict the purchase amounts for customers based on historical transaction data and to provide actionable insights that can help businesses in strategic planning, improved customer satisfaction and increased profitability.

**Dataset:**

The train and test dataset used for this project has 5,50,068 records and 2,33,599 records respectively, and they have the following variables:

User_ID: A unique identifier for each user.

Product_ID: A unique identifier for each product.

Gender: The gender of the customer.

Age: The age range of the user.

Occupation: The occupation code of the user.

City_Category: The category of the city.

Stay_In_Current_City_Years: The number of years the user has stayed in the current city.

Marital_Status: The marital status of the user.

Product_Category_1: The main product category code.

Product_Category_2: The secondary product category code.

Product_Category_3: The tertiary product category code.

Purchase: The purchase amount (target variable).

**Project Description:**

• Performed Univariate Analysis on the Target Variable.

• Implemented Data Pre-Processing, Feature Encoding techniques and Data Transformations, in order to enhance the data prepared for machine learning model.

• Built a Linear Regression model to predict the customer purchase behavior.

• Improved the model performance using Grid Search.

• Developed a Spark ML Pipeline for the final model.

• Achieved an model accuracy of 66% from Linear Regression Model
